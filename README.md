# nsx-back-and-forth
VMware NSX official documents have a pull-down to select a version, but the 3.x series documentation does not show the 4.x series version, and vice versa.
This extension adds a link to the latest version of another system (4.2 for 3.x, 3.2 for 4.x) to each document in the pull-down for convenience in document comparison.
